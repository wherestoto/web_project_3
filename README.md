**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US guided by Practicum. Elements were made so they are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Figma**

* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AtbNbstbxWPcMqvF061V0R/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%7C-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

* Import images from Figma and optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster. 

**Notes**

* Started by building the highest resolution in the brief. 
* Compared flexbox and grid to see which was best for organizing elements.
* Added media queries so elements were optimized for smaller display sizes.
* Added additional media queries between breakpoints for smoother scaling.
* Published through GitHub Pages and added ```.nojekyll``` to root.

**Improvements**

* Toggle for English & Spanish versions of website.
